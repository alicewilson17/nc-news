To run this project locally, you will need to create the necessary environment variables.

To do this, create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. Into each file, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (for database names, see /db/setup.sql).

Check that these .env files are .gitignored.

Then run npm install.
